    /*
     *
     * Design an Email Processor:
     * 1) it should read emails from the inbox
     * 2) There is a Large Language Mode (LLM) API , which takes the email content as input , and gives an appropriate reply as output.
     *    Using LLM API is expensive, so you can call it max 100 requests per minute.
     * 3) Priority should be given to VIP customers.
     * 4) Email replies should be sent to the users.
     * 5) Ensure 60% emails sent are for VIP users. (if there are no emails from VIPs, send to non-VIPs)
     * 6) There should be no miss in the user replies.
     *
     *
     * Design the system to achieve the above requirements.
